# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Decided to take a different approach and wrote up a roadmap for myself based on Traversy Medias "Web Development In 2021 - A Practical Guide" youtube video. I focused on taking notes relating to the Foundational front-end section. 

**Thoughts**: This was a really good video for me to take notes from. Brad always explains things really well, hes clear and doesnt give un-necessary information. After working through the video and taking around 2 pages of notes, it was nice to see that I actually know a good amount og the basics as far as HTML and CSS is concerned. This has given me a good place to pick things up and has definitely boosted both my confidence and my motivation.

### Day 2: April 28th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed the CSS Grid Garden website today. A good primer for delving into more grid. 

**Thoughts:**: After setting myself a roadmap yesterday, I realised there a few gaps in my CSS knowledge (mainly grid and flexbox) so I decided to tackle CSS grid today. I used CSS Grid Garden to give myself a more simple look at the basics. Ive had a few unsuccessful attempts at learning grid in the past, so it it was good to find something that actually helped me get to grips with the idea with a more hands on approach. I completed all 28 tasks, despite task 27 causing me a couple of issues.

### Day 3: April 29th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Day two of learning CSS Grid. Watched The Net Ninja's playlist on Youtube

**Thoughts:**: After yesterdays success, I found Net Ninja's course was easy to follow. A few of the concepts are still a little muddled in my brain, but I feel confident enough to start playing with CSS Grid in my projects.
