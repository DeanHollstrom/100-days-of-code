# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 31, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Made an account with Frontendmentor and completed the desktop version of the Huddle landing page project. Will work on the desktop version for day 2.

**Thoughts:** Recreating the site was pretty straight forward, had a few issues with aligning the social icons and a few positioning issues towards the end. I would ideally want to refactor the site with CSS grid or flexbox.
