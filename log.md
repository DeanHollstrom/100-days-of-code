# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Decided to take a different approach and wrote up a roadmap for myself based on Traversy Medias "Web Development In 2021 - A Practical Guide" youtube video. I focused on taking notes relating to the Foundational front-end section. 

**Thoughts**: This was a really good video for me to take notes from. Brad always explains things really well, hes clear and doesnt give un-necessary information. After working through the video and taking around 2 pages of notes, it was nice to see that I actually know a good amount og the basics as far as HTML and CSS is concerned. This has given me a good place to pick things up and has definitely boosted both my confidence and my motivation.
